Place the official Google 'G' PNG here as `google.png`.

Steps:
1. Download the official 'G' logo PNG from Google's branding resources.
2. Save it to this folder as `google.png`.
3. Run:

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run -d chrome
```

The app expects the file at `assets/google.png` (registered in `pubspec.yaml`).
